# Express-TP - Pay-to-TP #

Looking for an alternative to nether portal highways in your SMP? Express-TP is a teleportation plugin that prompts you to pay a corresponding amount for teleporting to a certain player.

- **/etp (player to teleport to)**
  - The command executor will be prompted to pay the respective amount of diamonds
- Permission needed: **etp.use**  
- **/ltp (second arg : action or location)**
  - Second args: (list, create, remove)
  
- Permission needed: **ltp.use**


**Express-TP is:**
- **Customizable** (customize the default payment)
- **Dynamic** (customize the payment dynamically by adding a multiplier for how distant 2 players are)


**Upcomming Features:**
- More customizability (an example of this would be limits on how many times a command can be executed by a player)
- Customizable currency (diamonds, netherite, emerald, etc.)

This is my first spigot plugin so it may not be perfect as i'm still learning this API. If you have any feedbacks dm me @ Discord: B2D#9992
