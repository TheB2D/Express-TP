# Express-TP #

Looking for an alternative to nether portal highways in your SMP? Express-TP is a teleportation plugin that prompts you to pay a corresponding amount for teleporting to a certain player.

**Express-TP is:**
- **Customizable** (customize the default payment)
- **Dynamic** (customize the payment dynamically by adding a multiplier for how distant 2 players are)


**Upcomming Features:**
- Location warps with corresponding payment
- More customizability (an example of this would be limits on how many times a command can be executed by a player)

This is my first spigot plugin so it may not be perfect as i'm still learning this API. If you have any feedbacks dm me @ Discord: B2D#9992
